#Accessing MySQL Database using PHP within IBM Bluemix

Use this code to learn how simple it is to connect PHP to a MySQL database instance using IBM Bluemix

All the code (HTML and PHP) are on the same index.php page. This is surelly not the best development approach but since my focus is to show how simple is to make PHP and MySQL work, I decided to make it that way.

####Deploy your code and see it working

Just click the Bluemix button below to have this application deployed in your Bluemix area.

> **Note:**

> - I've added the mysqli class to the composer.json file.
> - The ClearDB MySQL Bluemix service is already set in the manifest.yml so it's created on your Bluemix in case you don't have that.
